Obersturmführer Hans Heissemeyer!

This is an order! The enemy is entering your territory. March the prisoners to another camp speedily. Eliminate any unnecessary casualties due to hypothermia (too slow) or exhaustion (too fast). The Reich can still make use of the prisoners. Punish attemts to escape, as success only encourages more such acts.

Sieg Heil
Sturmbannführer Karl Wilhelm Florstedt
